*New Do File for Foster Care Adoption Analysis (Jan 2024)
*Begin by cleaning the foster care files the same as the previous dataset. This means you should be starting with the following file:
*Foster Care Cleaning and Merging File. Note that this should be completed after the data are downloaded and saved as described in the README file. If you have not become familiar with the contents of the README file and the nature of the data, please read that before executing this do file.
clear
cd C:\Users\bearley2\Desktop
*Call the data
*Sort data based on merging criteria (this is a unique identifier for each child, the county fips code, and the year of reporting). Because the capitalization of recnumbr is inconsistent between years, you will notice the need to rename at times.
*You will repeat this same process and begin merging all the county level data from each year. Note that this will add up to a lot of memory and a fair amount of time to complete (depending on your machine and internet connection).

*****Notes from AFCARS Statistician Emails*********
*Q: The "iswaiting" variable that indicates a child is waiting for adoption represents the current pool of potential adoptive children for that year? In other words, the children who are discharged for adoption in that year are not included in the count for that pool? 
*A: Correct. Children who are discharged to Adoption (Exited=1; DisReasn=3; InAtEnd=0) are not included in the pool of children waiting for adoption (IsWaiting=1, Exited=0; InatEnd=1). 

******the following code is a bit of a sidetrack for identifying which counties have all years of data. It is not necessary to run.*****

The March RepDatMo is only for kids who were in care Oct 1 - March 31, but not after March 31." (email from Michael Dineen at AFCARS) This means that the adopt total for each county will change every six months, but those waiting for adoption is only reported in September and thus the adoption pool should be based on both March and September data.

gen norm_adopt= adopt_county/adopt_pool

*note that there are 39 instances where observations are missing. This is because the adoption pool is 0, so you cannot return a number when calculating norm_adopt. This impacts Allen County, IN (2003); Fulton County, GA (2016 and 2020); District of Columbia (2020); and San Francisco (2020)

*include and clean variable for foster child age in the state. Age at the start of each fiscal year has two variables across the 21 years of data. As shown below, sometimes there are observations (about 1 percent) that have AgeAtStart and ageatstart with a code. When this happened and the ages were different, they were averaged and rounded up (all averaged ages were only separated by one year). Additionally, any age at start reported as -1 were rounded up to 0. Finally, only ages under 19 were kept in the data (since aging out technically occurs once children become adults). This removed 0 observations.
